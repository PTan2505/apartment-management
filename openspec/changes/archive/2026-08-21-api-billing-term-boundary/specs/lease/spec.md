## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Lease status, expected end date, and tenant are derived
The system SHALL derive a lease's expected end date from its start date and agreed duration, its status from whether a move-out date is recorded, its tenant from the current primary occupant, and its deposit amount from the agreed rent and the number of deposit months. None of these SHALL be independently settable, so they can never contradict the records they come from.

A date that ends a tenancy SHALL be **exclusive**: it is the first day the tenancy no longer covers, and the last day covered is the day before it. This SHALL hold for both the expected end date and the move-out date, so that a reader never has to remember which of them counts its own day and which does not.

A lease beginning 1 January for six months therefore has an expected end date of 1 July and covers through 30 June. A lease whose move-out is recorded as 5 July covers through 4 July. In both cases a new lease beginning on that same date follows with neither a gap nor an overlap.

The expected end date SHALL NOT constrain the move-out date. It states when the agreement ends, not when the tenant left — a tenant may stay past it without either party wanting a renewal, and the record SHALL be able to say so.

The deposit amount SHALL be reported alongside the number of months it was agreed in, so that a caller can show either without computing it. It SHALL follow the lease's own agreed rent rather than the room's current rent, because the deposit was agreed against the rent in the lease.

#### Scenario: Expected end date reflects start date and duration
- **WHEN** an authenticated owner retrieves a lease starting 2026-01-15 with an agreed duration of 12 months
- **THEN** the response reports an expected end date of 2027-01-15

#### Scenario: The expected end date is the first day not covered
- **WHEN** a lease begins 2026-01-01 with an agreed duration of six months
- **THEN** its expected end date is 2026-07-01 and the last day it covers is 2026-06-30

#### Scenario: A renewal begins where the previous term ended
- **WHEN** a lease's expected end date is 2026-07-01 and a new lease for the same room begins on that date
- **THEN** the two tenancies neither overlap nor leave a day uncovered

#### Scenario: A move-out date is the first day not covered
- **WHEN** a lease records a move-out dated 2026-07-05
- **THEN** the last day it covers is 2026-07-04

#### Scenario: A renewal begins on the date the previous tenancy ended
- **WHEN** a lease records a move-out dated 2026-07-05 and a new lease for the same room begins on 2026-07-05
- **THEN** the two tenancies neither overlap nor leave a day uncovered

#### Scenario: A tenant who left after the term is recorded as they left
- **WHEN** an authenticated owner records a move-out dated after the lease's expected end date, because the tenant stayed on and neither party wanted a renewal
- **THEN** the system accepts it and records that date, rather than requiring a date that did not happen

#### Scenario: Lease without a move-out date is active
- **WHEN** an authenticated owner retrieves a lease that has no move-out date
- **THEN** the response reports the lease as active

#### Scenario: Lease with a move-out date is finalized
- **WHEN** an authenticated owner retrieves a lease that has a move-out date
- **THEN** the response reports the lease as finalized

#### Scenario: Expected end date follows an updated duration
- **WHEN** an authenticated owner changes a lease's agreed duration
- **THEN** the expected end date reported for that lease changes accordingly

#### Scenario: Reported tenant follows a transfer of responsibility
- **WHEN** primary responsibility for a lease is transferred to another occupant
- **THEN** the lease reports that person as its tenant

#### Scenario: Deposit amount is derived from the agreed rent
- **WHEN** an authenticated owner retrieves a lease with an agreed rent of 3,000,000 and a deposit of two months
- **THEN** the response reports a deposit amount of 6,000,000

#### Scenario: A zero-month deposit reports a zero amount
- **WHEN** an authenticated owner retrieves a lease whose deposit is zero months
- **THEN** the response reports a deposit amount of zero

#### Scenario: Deposit amount ignores a later change to the room's rent
- **WHEN** a room's base rent is changed after a lease on it was created
- **THEN** that lease still reports a deposit amount derived from its own agreed rent

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Owner can create a lease
The system SHALL allow an authenticated `owner` to create a lease for an existing active room, naming an existing customer as the lease signatory and recording a start date, an agreed duration in whole months, an occupant count, and the electricity meter reading the tenancy starts from. Duration and occupant count MUST both be at least 1. Creating the lease SHALL also record the signatory as the lease's primary occupant, and the two SHALL be created together so a lease never exists without one. The starting meter reading SHALL default to the room's latest known meter reading — the most recent of its previous lease's closing reading and any vacancy reading recorded since — and MAY be overridden by the owner, so that electricity consumed while the room stood empty is not charged to the incoming tenant. Where the room has no previous lease, the reading MUST be supplied.

#### Scenario: Successful creation
- **WHEN** an authenticated owner creates a lease for an active, unoccupied room naming an existing customer as signatory, with a valid start date, duration, occupant count, and starting meter reading
- **THEN** the system creates the lease as active, records the signatory as its primary occupant, and responds with HTTP 201 and the created lease

#### Scenario: Starting reading defaults to the previous tenancy's closing reading
- **WHEN** an authenticated owner creates a lease for a room whose previous lease recorded a closing meter reading, without supplying a starting reading
- **THEN** the lease starts from that closing reading

#### Scenario: Owner overrides the starting reading after a vacancy
- **WHEN** an authenticated owner creates a lease supplying a starting meter reading higher than the previous lease's closing reading, because the meter advanced while the room was empty
- **THEN** the system records the supplied reading, so the incoming tenant is not charged for consumption from the vacant period

#### Scenario: Room has no previous lease
- **WHEN** an authenticated owner creates the first lease for a room without supplying a starting meter reading
- **THEN** the system responds with HTTP 400, because there is no previous reading to fall back on and assuming zero would charge the tenant for the meter's whole history

#### Scenario: Meter was replaced between tenancies
- **WHEN** an authenticated owner creates a lease supplying a starting meter reading lower than the previous lease's closing reading, because the meter was replaced
- **THEN** the system records the supplied reading as the new baseline

#### Scenario: Negative starting meter reading
- **WHEN** an authenticated owner supplies a negative starting meter reading
- **THEN** the system responds with HTTP 400 and does not create the lease

#### Scenario: Signatory does not exist
- **WHEN** an authenticated owner creates a lease naming a customer id that does not exist
- **THEN** the system responds with HTTP 404 and creates neither the lease nor an occupant record

#### Scenario: Room does not exist
- **WHEN** an authenticated owner creates a lease referencing a room id that does not exist
- **THEN** the system responds with HTTP 404 and does not create the lease

#### Scenario: Room is retired
- **WHEN** an authenticated owner creates a lease for a room that has been retired
- **THEN** the system responds with HTTP 400 and does not create the lease

#### Scenario: Invalid duration or occupant count
- **WHEN** an authenticated owner submits a duration or occupant count below 1
- **THEN** the system responds with HTTP 400 and does not create the lease

#### Scenario: Signatory has no phone number
- **WHEN** an authenticated owner creates a lease naming a customer who has no phone number recorded
- **THEN** the system responds with HTTP 400, because the person responsible for the agreement must be contactable

#### Scenario: Default follows a vacancy reading recorded after the previous tenancy
- **WHEN** an authenticated owner creates a lease for a room whose vacancy electricity was recorded after its previous lease ended, without supplying a starting reading
- **THEN** the lease starts from the most recent vacancy reading rather than the previous lease's closing reading, because the owner has already paid for the consumption in between
